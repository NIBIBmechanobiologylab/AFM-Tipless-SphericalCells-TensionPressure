# "Actomyosin Cortical Mechanical Properties in Nonadherent Cells Determined by Atomic Force Microscopy"

## **What is this analysis?**

This repository is based on the methodology developed by Cartagena-Rivera et al.: “Actomyosin Cortical Mechanical Properties in Nonadherent Cells Determined by Atomic Force Microscopy” which measures mechanics such as surface tension and hydrostatic pressure of soft spherical specimens.

Specifically, this is a Matlab-based analysis of Bruker AFM data output files (Bruker Catalyst) with accompanying GUI that enables easier visualization and user-defined fitting of linear regions of force curves. This analysis is meant to analyze force curves taken using soft tipless AFM cantilevers, as presented in the [main document](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349516302375?via%3Dihub#sec2).

### Matlab requirements:
Matlab (supports R2020b)
  - Curve Fitting Toolbox
